A C++ program that uses OpenCV and the Ensenso API for 3D object recognition. Acquires a colored 3D image of a wounded body from an Ensenso 3D camera and processes the RGB data of that image to extract the 3D contour of the wound, which is to be used for tracing the path of an ink-jet nozzle that will fill the wound with healing fluids.
